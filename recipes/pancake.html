        <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

        <h2>Pancake Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
            <li>Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
            <li>Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Make Pancakes From Scratch</h2>
